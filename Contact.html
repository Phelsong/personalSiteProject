            Nathan F. 
            <ul><li>"Josh was awesome to work with. I came into Dallas from
            out of town and Josh pulled together an amazing shoot with only a
            few days notice. He brings the kind of confidence that comes from
            knowing your craft, your gear and delivering high level results.
            Josh was easy to work with, flexible in taking direction and the HD
            audio and video he delivered with his RED was perfection. As a video
            producer, when my clients look and sound this good, my stock rises.
            Josh will help your stock rise too. He will over deliver and go the
            extra mile to make sure your project looks amazing. I call it
            professional pride. He'd probably say "That's just how I roll."
            Highly recommended." June 5, 2017

            <ul><li>My career took another level "After struggling during
            three years trying to find a video-producer for my music video and
            wasting a lot of money . I finally met Josh in 2016 and his work was
            a real surprise for me the price that he gave me and the service
            were so affordable. The results were also amazing my image changed
            in front of my fans. I even got more fans in one month than I
            couldn't do in one year. He is my favorite producer now. I encourage
            you to work with him you will not be disappointed" September 1, 2016
